AnchorPy is the gateway to interacting with [Anchor](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor) programs in Python.
It provides:

- A [static client generator](clientgen)
- A [dynamic client](dynamic_client) similar to `anchor-ts`
- A [Pytest plugin](testing/#1-pytest-plugin)
- A [CLI](cli) with various utilities for Anchor Python development.

## Installation (requires Python >= 3.9)

```shell
pip install anchorpy[cli]
```


!!! note
    These docs will assume you've read the [Anchor documentation](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) first.
