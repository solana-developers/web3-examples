# AnchorPy


AnchorPy is the gateway to interacting with [Anchor](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor) programs in Python.
It provides:

- A static client generator
- A dynamic client similar to `anchor-ts`
- A Pytest plugin
- A CLI with various utilities for Anchor Python development.




## Installation (requires Python >=3.9)

```sh
pip install anchorpy[cli]

```
Or, if you're not using the CLI features of AnchorPy you can just run `pip install anchorpy`.

### Development Setup

If you want to contribute to AnchorPy, follow these steps to get set up:

1. Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
2. Install dev dependencies:
```sh
poetry install

```
3. Install [nox-poetry](https://github.com/cjolowicz/nox-poetry) (note: do not use Poetry to install this, see [here](https://medium.com/@cjolowicz/nox-is-a-part-of-your-global-developer-environment-like-poetry-pre-commit-pyenv-or-pipx-1cdeba9198bd))
4. Activate the poetry shell:
